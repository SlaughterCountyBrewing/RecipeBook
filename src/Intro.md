## Notes

- Target batch size is always 93 gal (3 BBL)
- Kettle fill volume: 98 gal (pre-boil)
- Dough-in was acomplished by pouring in muck-tubs of grain while filling from the spray-ball.  We would throttle the fill rate as needed, but the timing just generally worked pretty well.  
- after dough-in, rest time is XXXXXX
- after rest, we'd recirc (recirculate / lauter) for 45 mins.
